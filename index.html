<h1> My name is Lynette! </h1> 
<p> Nice to meet you! Some things about me are that I was born November 13th, 2004 In Virginia but moved to North Carolina when I was little. 
I love trying different looks and styles on myself, Also a festival girl. I Love going to different concerts, shows and festivals. I have 2 cats one named
"Ibiza" which is a black domestic shorthair and "Izelle" a white Persian ( Yin and Yang), For the most part I usually spend my time studying and relaxing with them. </p>
