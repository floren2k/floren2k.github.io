<h1> My name is Lynette! </h1> 
Nice to meet you! Some things about me are that I was born November 13th, 2004 In Virginia but moved to North Carolina when I was little.
        I grew up in Durham but moved to Raleigh a few years ago, I am hoping to move to a different state once I am done with school.Some things 
        I love to do are, going out to different shows and festivals, I also love doing makeup and Shopping. I have 2 cats one named "Ibiza" which
        is a black domestic shorthair and "Izelle" a white Persian ( Yin and Yang), For the most part I usually spend my time studying and relaxing 
        with them. </p>
