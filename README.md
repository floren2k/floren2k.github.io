# About me
## My Interests
I really enjoy listening to music and going to different concerts and music festivals. Some academic interests of mine are website building and Game development, I find it interesting that people are able to build complex games up from scratch. Some other things I enjoy is sitting by the beach, yoga, and tennis (even though I am not very good at it). 
## Websites I Find Interesting 
* [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com)   
Which, I havent played in years. My sister actually reminded me of it when I began this course because she said that if I actually learn to code I would be able to build a game for her. It made me realize that this is literally a platform where different people are able to create games and users are able to browse and use said games. Which, in this age is a simple concept but I find it so cool.
* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/)  
  I know so original, I actually dont use the app, I have in the past but its algorithm is like no other. There has been times where I would simply think of something and there would be a video of it on TIktok. How does one design a website/app that literally predicts and shows you exatly what you want to see? Also find it interesting that its the first social media app (that I know of) getting banned in this country.
